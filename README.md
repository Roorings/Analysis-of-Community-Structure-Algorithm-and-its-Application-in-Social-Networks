# Analysis of Community Structure Algorithm and its Application in Social Networks

[ABSTRACT]: Community division is a very important branch of modern network science. With the development of technology as well as the rise of the Internet and social media, its application has provided certain help to human po- litical and economic life. In the past two decades, as a key issue in network sci- ence, many scholars have proposed community classification algorithms based on different principles. This paper reviews the development of network science and introduces the meaning of community division and the origin of the social network. It describes two community division algorithms, uses the benchmark network to determine the accuracy and robustness, and applies them to the real network for analysis. The paper mainly introduces the principle of modularity and the idea of the Fast Greedy algorithm based on modularity; clarifies the concept of information entropy and the core of Infomap algorithm using two- layer coding and random walk. Using the normalized mutual information as the criterion for the accuracy of community division, the Lancichinetti–Fortu- nato–Radicchi benchmark and Girvan-Newman benchmark are selected as the two prior community partition networks. Then, modifying the number of edges connecting inside and outside the community to calculate the NMI of the two community detection algorithms, and apply them to the E-mail network and DBLP collaboration network with real classification to divide the community. Algorithms are compared and judged based on multiple perspectives, and the principles and applications of community division algorithms are analysed, and conclude the paper with an exploration of future research directions on commu- nity structure algorithms.

# 社团结构算法分析及其在社交网络上的应用

[摘要]:社团划分是现代网络科学中一个非常重要的分支，随着科学技 术的发展和互联网与社交媒体的兴起，其运用范围为人类政治和经济生 活提供了一定的帮助。近二十年来，社团作为网络科学中一个关键问题， 许多学者提出了基于不同原理下的社团分类算法。本文回顾了网络科学 的发展，介绍了社团划分的意义和社交网络的缘起，分析了基于模块度的 Fast Newman 贪心算法和基于信息熵的 Infomap 算法的原理和概念，探究 其潜在的缺点及适用网络。介绍并选取 LFR 和 GN 两个拥有本身社团划 分的基准网络，修改社团内外连接的边数计算两个算法的归一化互信息， 运用到拥有真实分类的电子邮件网络和计算机合作网络进行社团划分算 法的对比和判断，并对社团划分算法的原理及应用进行了分析及展望。
